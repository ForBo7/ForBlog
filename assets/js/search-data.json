            "content": "Nǐ shì rén? . And so I have completed Lesson 2 of Living Language’s Essential Chinese: People and Family. In this lesson, I learned about how certain people are referred to as well as certain grammatical insights. . I have to say, this chapter was particularly interesting because I saw how the Chinese think, in terms of language. I have studied English Language in high school, including how the language developed over the centuries, how children pick up langauge, how English has spread globally, and language and the self. . Observations . Male and Female . Indicating if a person is male or female is generally straightforward: you prefix nǔ (female) or nán (male) — yes, yes, this probably does not cover all cases. . For example, person in Mandarin is rén. Therefore, woman is nǔrén (female person) and man is nánrén (male person). . Boy is nánhái and girl is nǔhái. I infer that hái must mean something in the bout of a child. . There is also no verbal difference when referring to a male or female. He/him/she/her is all spoken using the same term: tā. However, there is a written difference. He/him is 他 and she/her is 她. . The Chinese then perhaps do not make a distinction between males and females, and perhaps rather let the context of the situation speak for itself. . Conjugates and Articles . Simply put, conjugates are terms such as “to be”, “is”, “are”, “was”, and “will be”. In Chinese, there is none of that nonsense. You use a single term for every thing, person, and all times including past, present, and future. That term is shì (是). . Articles are terms such as “a”, “an”, and “the”. Similarly, Chinese has none of that nonsense and uses no such terms. . The Chinese then probably do not have strict concepts of time, as is seen by the use of shì for past, present, and future. They perhaps think of time as one continuous flow. This is also seen by the term yǒu, which is used for have had, to have, and will have. . Plurals . To make any pronoun plural, you simply append -men (们) to the end. . nǐ (你）—&gt; nǐmen (你们) | wǒ (我) —&gt; wǒmen (我们) | tā (他) —&gt; tāmen (他们) | . I have noticed that there is perhaps no distinction between plural and singular nouns. Take the below sentences as an example. Xuésheng means student. . They are a student. (Tāmen shì xuésheng.) . They are our students. (Tāmen shì wǒmen xuésheng.) . Xuésheng is used for both student and students. . Family . The terms used to refer to siblings are very easy to pronounce. Perhaps so that young children can easily speak them, as is seen below: . younger brother: dìdi | older brother: gēge | younger sister: mèimei | older sister: jiějie | . More Strokes . Tí . As it sounds, goes from bottom left to top right. . ㇀ . It can be longer or shorter than what is shown above and can also be more horizontal/shallow too. . Shùgōu . It is a shù with with a gōu. . 亅 . Wāngōu . It is a shùgōu with an initial curve. . ㇁ . Shùtí1 . It is a shù with a tí. . . Xiégōu . It is like a curved shùtí. . ㇂ . Nà . It is like a mirrored piě. . ㇏ . It can be more horizontal or vertical than what is shown above. . Hanzì Characters . Hanzì characters can never contain more than one nà stroke. . Conclusion . That concludes my observation for Lesson 2. If you have any comments, suggestions, or corrections, please do put them down in the comments section below! . Next up is Lesson 3: Numbers!

            "title": "Nǐ hǎo!",
            "content": "Nǐ hǎo ma? . A fitting title for my first blog post! . So begins my venture into learning Mandarin! I am actually excited to begin learning a new language, partly because I also had a full physical course laying about. . The course in question is Living Language Chinese Complete Edition. It comes with four books (essential, intermediate, advanced, and a character guide) along with six audio CDs. Reviews for the Chinese course from Living Language seemed good too, though people tended to praise the older version more which is the one I have (I think). . . Let’s move on to what I have observed so far in learning this language, from Lesson 1 of the course. . Observations . Greetings . Nǐ hǎo. | Nǐ hǎo ma? | Nǐ ne? | . Nǐ must refer to the other person (you). . Wǒ hěn hǎo. | hěn hǎo | . Hǎo must refer to the good state [of someone]. . Tones . There are five tones in Mandarin. You can tell how to pronounce each tone by simply looking at its shape. . First tone . ā . A flat, high pitched tone. . Second tone . á . A rising tone, from medium to high pitch. . Third tone . ǎ . A scooping tone, from low to medium pitch. . Fourth tone . à . A falling tone, similar to when you say “yes” or “no” in response to a question, or when you saying something you really mean. . Fifth tone . a . A neutral, medium pitched tone. . Asking for help . Qǐng ràng yī xià? | Dǎrǎo yī xià? | Qǐngwèn yī xià? | . “yī xià” is probably used for those questions where you ask somebody for a favor or for an action from them. . “ma”, on the other hand, is probably used to turn a phrase into a question. . Hanzì strokes . Observations from Character Guide book, Lesson 1 — Basic Strokes. . Héng . As it sounds, is a horizontal line from left to right. . 一 . Shù . As it sounds, is a vertical line from top to bottom. . 丨 . Piě . Is like a curved shù that can be shallow or deep. The deep variant is shown below. . 丿 . Diǎn . Is sort of like a diagonal dot. Can be drawn from top left to bottom right or top right to bottom left. Essentially can only be drawn starting from the top. . 丶 . Zhé . Is like héng, but has a hook at the end. . 乛 . “hook” in pīnyīn is gōu. Therefore, zhé is also known as hénggōu. . Hanzì Characters . I have noticed that a single hanzì character corresponds to a single syllable. . Conclusion . Well then, that concludes my initial observation and things learned in Mandarin. I’ll be making more of these sorts of posts as I continue my learning journey. . I would appreciate any comments, corrections, and suggesstions! .",
