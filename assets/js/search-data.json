            "content": "Nǐ hǎo ma? . A fitting title for my first blog post! . So begins my venture into learning Mandarin! I am actually excited to begin learning a new language, partly because I also had a full physical course laying about. . The course in question is Living Language Chinese Complete Edition. It comes with four books (essential, intermediate, advanced, and a character guide) along with six audio CDs. Reviews for the Chinese course from Living Language seemed good too, though people tended to praise the older version more which is the one I have (I think). . . Let’s move on to what I have observed so far in learning this language, from Lesson 1 of the course. . Observations . Greetings . Nǐ hǎo. | Nǐ hǎo ma? | Nǐ ne? | . Nǐ must refer to the other person (you). . Wǒ hěn hǎo. | hěn hǎo | . Hǎo must refer to the good state [of someone]. . Tones . There are five tones in Mandarin. You can tell how to pronounce each tone by simply looking at its shape. . First tone . ā . A flat, high pitched tone. . Second tone . á . A rising tone, from medium to high pitch. . Third tone . ǎ . A scooping tone, from low to medium pitch. . Fourth tone . à . A falling tone, similar to when you say “yes” or “no” in response to a question, or when you saying something you really mean. . Fifth tone . a A neutral, medium pitched tone. . Asking for help . Qǐng ràng yī xià? | Dǎrǎo yī xià? | Qǐngwèn yī xià? | . “yī xià” is probably used for those questions where you ask somebody for a favor or for an action from them. . “ma”, on the other hand, is probably used to turn a phrase into a question. . Hanzì strokes . Observations from Character Guide book, Lesson 1 — Basic Strokes. . Héng . As it sounds, is a horizontal line from left to right. . 一 . Shù . As it sounds, is a vertical line from top to bottom. . 丨 . Piě . Is like a curved shù that can be shallow or deep. The deep variant is shown below. . 丿&lt;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; **Diǎn** Is sort of like a diagonal dot. Can be drawn from top left to bottom right or top right to bottom left. Essentially can only be drawn starting from the top. 丶 . **Zhé** Is like héng, but has a hook at the end. 乛 . &quot;hook&quot; in pīnyīn is gōu. Therefore, zhé is also known as hénggōu. ## Conclusion Well then, that concludes my initial observation and things learned in Mandarin. I&#39;ll be making more of these sorts of posts as I continue my learning journey. I would appreciate any comments, corrections, and suggesstions! .",
