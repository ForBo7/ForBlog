You can check out my Hiragana post [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/japanese/hiragana/2022/08/13/Hiragana.html).

Katakana is the Japanese writing system that is mainly used for loan words and 
foriegn names. Katakana for the most part works exactly like Hiragana.

## Katakana Syllables

Every Hiragana syllable has a Katakana counterpart. There are 46 main 
Katakana syllables, though more exist which I will go over in a later section. 

|  | a | i | u | e | o |
|  | ア | イ | ウ | エ | オ |
| k | カ | キ | ク | ケ | コ |
| s | サ | シ (shi) | ス | セ | ソ |
| t | タ | チ (chi) | ツ (tsu) | テ | ト |
| n | ナ | ニ | ヌ | ネ | ノ |
| h | ハ | ヒ | フ (fu) | ヘ | ホ |
| m | マ | ミ | ム | メ | モ |
| y | ヤ |  | ユ |  | ヨ |
| r | ラ | リ | ル | レ | ロ |
| w | ワ |  |  |  | ヲ (o/wo) |

| n | ン |

シ, チ, ツ, and フ sound different and is shown in brackets. However, the 
romanization is only an approximation.

シ and チ can be described to be shallower versions of _sh_ and _ch_.

ツ can be described to have an initial light _t_ sound.

フ can be described to be a heavy _hu_ sound that is a blend between _hu_ and 
_fu_.

### Observations

These characters are a lot more "sharp" and straight. They also feel a lot 
more like Chinese characters.

シ and ツ look really similar too. How I like remembering them is that シ is more 
shallow whereas ツ is more deep.

Similarly, ソ is more deep whereas ン is more shallow.

## Katakana with Diacritical Marks

[//]: # (TODO: Insert Hiragana image here.)

Just like Hiragana, a further 25 syllables can be derived with the diacritic 
marks ゛and ゜. However, there are a few extra variations which I will get to 
in a later section.

|  | a | i | u | e | o |
| k | カ | キ | ク | ケ | コ |
| g | ガ | ギ | グ | ゲ | ゴ |
| s | サ | シ (shi) | ス | セ | ソ |
| z | ザ | ジ (ji) | ズ | ゼ | ゾ |
| t | タ | チ (chi) | ツ (tsu) | テ | ト |
| d | ダ | ヂ (ji) | ヅ (tzu) | デ | ド |
| h | ハ | ヒ | フ (fu) | ヘ | ホ |
| b | バ | ビ | ブ | ベ | ボ |


|  | a | e | u | e | o |
| h | ハ | ヒ | フ (fu) | ヘ | ホ |
| p | パ | ピ | プ | ペ | ポ |


## Transcribing Contracted Sounds

Again, just like Hiragana, a further 21 syllables can be derived using small ヤ,
ユ, and ヨ. However, like before, there are further small vowels that are used 
which I will discuss in a section below.

|  | ya | yu | yo |
| k | キャ | キュ | キョ |
| s | シャ (sha) | シュ (shu) | ショ (sho) |
| t | チャ (cha) | チュ (chu) | チョ (cho) |
| n | ニャ | ニュ | ニョ |
| h | ヒャ | ヒュ | ヒョ |
| m | ミャ | ミュ | ミョ |
| r | リャ | リュ | リオ |

|  | ya | yu | yo |
| g | ギャ | ギュ | ギョ |
| z | ジャ (ja) | ジュ (ju) | ジョ (jo) |
| b | ビャ | ビュ | ビョ |
| p | ピャ | ピュ | ピョ |

The イ vowel syllables are used for contraction.

## Double Consonants and Long Vowels

The same rules from Hiragana apply: small ツ is used to transcribe double 
consonants, except when transcribing double consonant n sounds. Instead, ン 
is used along with a Katakana that has an initial n sound.

Unlike Hiragana though, when transcribing long vowel sounds, extra vowel 
syllables are not added. Instead, ー is used. When writing vertically, ー 
becomes ｜.

**Hiragana**
> おばあさん — obaasan \
> えいが — eega

**Katakana**
> カー — kaa (car) \
> ボール — booru (ball)

## Transcribing Foreign Sounds

Katakana is the writing system used for loan words. As such, not all sounds 
can be represented in Japanese (such as _l_). However, extra Katakana 
characters have been made to accomodate for extra sounds that do not exist 
through the use of small vowels (ァ、ィ、ゥ、ェ、ォ) and diacritics.

|  | a | i | u | e | o |
| s |  |  |  | シェ (she) |  |
| z |  |  |  | ジェ (je) |  |
| t |  | ティ | トゥ |  |  |
| d |  | ヂィ | ドゥ |  |  |
| h | ファ (fa) | フィ (fi) |  | フェ (fu) | フォ (fo) |
| w |  | ウィ | ウ | ウェ | ウォ |
| v | ヴァ | ヴィ | ヴ | ヴェ | ヴォ |

## Conclusion

After learning both the Hiragana and Katakana, Japanese has come to be a 
very interesting language due to how words and syllables are structured and 
by the lack of certain sounds. Japanese feels "basic" (not in a bad way) in the 
sense that there are much fewer sounds which are also preset. For example, in English, 
let's say we have the letter _k_. You can add any letter you want afterwards.
However, in Japanese, you have _k_ that is combined with a vowel; that is, 
you don't have _k_ by itself. 

Reading English words that have been brought in through Katakana is also 
quite interesting and amusing at times.
