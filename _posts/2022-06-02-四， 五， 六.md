## Introduction
Numbers are easy in Mandarin, perhaps even easier than English.

Below are observations from Lesson 3: Numbers of the Living Language 
Essential Chinese book.

## Observations

### Zero to Ten

- líng
- yī
- èr
- sān
- sì
- wǔ
- liù
- qī
- bā
- jiǔ
- shí

But what is easy about this?

### Eleven to Nineteen

To say the teens, you say ten then the appropriate number. So instead of 
saying twelve, you would say ten two.

- shíyī
- shí'èr
- shísān
- shísì
- shíwǔ
- shíliù
- shíqī
- shíbā
- shíjiǔ

### Twenty to Ninety

See how easy it is? Saying the tens is similar. You first say ten then the 
appropriate number. Instead of saying twenty, you say two ten.

- èrshí
- sānshí
- sìshí
- wǔshí
- liùshí
- qīshí
- bāshí
- jiǔshí

### Hundred to Million

The logic previously applied works similarly for hundred to million.

- Hundred is **bǎi**
- Thousand is **qiān**
- Ten thousand is **wàn** or **yīwàn**

Therefore,

- One hundred is **yībǎi**
- Two thousand is **èrqiān**
- Thirty thousand is **sānwàn**

Wàn is treated as its own unit, similar to hundred, thousand or million. It 
would be ten thousand in English by one wàn in Mandarin.

Wàn is also similar to lakh in Urdu. One lakh in one hundred thousand in 
English.

### Turning Strokes

Hanzì also contains turning strokes; that is, strokes that contain turns and 
are written in one continuous flow (ignore that fact that the images for the 
turning strokes below look like they are composed of multiple strokes). 

Below are five.

**Héngzhé**
It is a héng with a shù.

**Héngzhégōu**

It is a héngzhé with a gōu.

**Shùzhé**

It is a shù with a héng.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-06-02/shùzhé.svg" width=75
alt="Shùzhé Stroke">

This turning stoke can either have a short shù with a long héng or a long 
shù with a short héng.

**Piězhé**

It is a piě with a héng.

The angle between the two can differ at times.

**Shùwāngōu**

It's a shù with a wāngāou rotated 90 degrees. Easier to remember it as a 
whole new stroke than it being a composed of individual strokes.

### Measure Words

Mandarin uses measure words when dealing with quantities. Measure words are 
similar to "pair" in "one pair of shoes" and "glass" in "five glasses of water".

The most common measure word is gè and is used essentially used for people 
and places (the book states people, cities, groups, and nations).

This is how you would state the following in Mandarin:

> He has three students.
> 
> Tā yǒu sān gè xuésheng.

> I have one younger brother. 
> 
> Wǒ yǒu yī gè dìdi.

### Dual Quantities

When dealing with quantities that have two of something, liǎng is used in 
place of èr.

You would not say:

> Nǐmen yǒu èr gè lǎoshī.

Instead, you would say:

> Nǐmen yǒu liǎng gè lǎoshī.

### Plurals

As I suspected previously in this 
[post](http://forbo7.github.io/ForBlog/mandarin/hanzì/2022/05/26/Mandarin-People-and-Family.html#plurals),
there are no plurals in Mandarin.

## Conclusion

That completes my observations for lesson 3! The next post will be about 
objects around the house, which includes a few more measure words.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or corrections, please do post them
