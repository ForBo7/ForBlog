Takeaways from Lesson 4: Around the Home from the Living Language Essential 
Chinese book.

## Observations

### Prefixes and Suffixes

I infer that diàn (电) has to do with technology:
- diànshì (电视) — television
- diànhuà (电话) — telephone
- diànnǎo (电脑) — computer

I infer that chē (车) has to do with mobility:
- qìchē (汽车) — car
- zìxíngchē (自行车) — bicycle

I also infer that zi (子) has something to do with furniture:
- zhuōzi (桌子) — table
- yǐzi (椅子) — chair

My inference for diàn (电) was in the ballpark! As later on, the lesson said 
that diàn (电) has to with electricity.

### Who and Whom

The word shéi (谁) is used for both who and whom. When used in question, shéi 
(谁) negates the use of ma (吗). When responding, replace shéi (谁) with the 
appropriate pronoun.

> Shéi yǒu zhuōzi? （谁有桌子？）
> 
> Tā yǒu yī zhāng zhuōzi. （他有一张桌子。）

> Shéi yǒu diànnǎo? （谁有电脑？）
> 
> Tāmen yǒu diànnǎo. （他们有电脑。）

### And

'and' (hé/和) is frequently omitted in Mandarin. A comma is used in its place.

> I have three computers and two cars.
> 
> Wǒ yǒu sān tái diànnǎo, liǎng liàng qìchē. (我有三台电脑，两辆汽车。)

### More Turning Strokes

#### **Héngzhéwāngōu**

The héngzhéwāngōu turning stroke looks like ح in Urdu.

<p style="font-size:40px; text-align:center;">乙</p>

#### **Héngzhézhézhégōu**

This turning stroke is a héngzhé followed by a héngzhégōu.

<p style="font-size:40px; text-align:center;">𠄎</p>

#### **Shùzhézhégōu**

It is a shùzhé followed by a shùgōu.

<p style="font-size:40px; text-align:center;">㇉</p>

#### **Héngpiě**

This is simply, as stated in by its name, a héng followed by a piě.

<p style="font-size:40px; text-align:center;">㇇</p>

#### **Héngpiěwāngōu**

The héngpiěwāngōu, as also stated by its name, is a héngpiě followed by a 
wāngōu.

<p style="font-size:40px; text-align:center;">㇌</p>

This turning stroke is also known as the guàěr stroke because it resembles 
an ear.

#### **The meaning of zhé**

Theses turning strokes include a lot of "zhé" in their name. I infer that 
zhé has something to do with turns made in the stroke itself.

### More Measure Words

#### **běn**

This measure word is essentially used for books (the book states books, 
photo albums, and magazines).

> Wǒ yǒu sān běn shū. (我有三本书。)

#### **liàng**

This measure word is essentially used for vehicles (the book states cars, 
taxis, and bicycles.)

> Xiānsheng yǒu liǎng liàng qìchē. （先生有两辆汽车。）

> Wǒmen yǒu sì liàng zìxíngchē. (我们有四辆自行车。)

#### **tái**

This measure is used for machines (e.g., computers, televisions, sewing 
machines, air conditioners).

> Nánhái yǒu yī tái diànshì. (男孩有一台电视。)

> Jiějie yǒu yī tái diànhuà. (姐姐有一台电话。)

#### **zhāng**

This measure word is essentially used for furniture (the book states tables, 
desks, and chairs.)

> Lǎoshī yǒu èrshí'èr zhāng yǐzi, shíyī zhāng zhuōzi. (老师有二十二张椅子，十一张桌子。)

## Conclusion

That concludes my observations from this lesson. Up next: descriptions, 
adjectives, and colors.

And since you've made it to the end, "bīngxiāng" is "refrigerator" in Mandarin!
