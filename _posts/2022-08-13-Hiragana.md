So begins my journey into Japanese! To start of with, I will be learning the 
Hiragana alphabet.

## Japanese Writing System

There are three writing systems:
* Hiragana
* Katakana
* Kanji

Hiragana and Katakana are collectively known as Kana. Kana represent 
phonetic sounds whereas Kanji are Chinese characters.

**Hiragana** can be identified from its more curvy shapes. It is used for:
* conjugation endings
* function words
* native Japanese words that do not have a Kanji represnetation

**Katakana** can be identified from its more straight, sharp shapes. It is 
used for:
* loan words
* foreign names

**Kanji** is mainly used for:
* nouns
* stems of verbs
* stems of adjectives

## Hiragana Syllables

There are 46 main Hiragana syllables. Some written Hiragana syllables differ
from print Hiragana.

|　| a | i | u | e | o |
| | あ | い | う | え | お |
| k | か | き | く | け | こ |
| s | さ | し (shi) | す | せ | そ |
| t | た | ち (chi) | つ (tsu) | て | と |
| n | な | に | ぬ | ね | の |
| h | は | ひ | ふ (fu) | へ | ほ |
| m | ま | め | む | め | も |
| y | や | | ゆ | | よ |
| r | ら | り | る | れ | ろ |
| w | わ | | | | を (o/wo) |

| n | ん |

し, ち, つ, and ふ sound different and is shown in brackets. The romanization 
in the brackets are only an approximation.

し and ち can be described to be shallower versions of the "sh" and "ch" 
sounds respectively.

つ can be described to have a light initial "t" sound.

ふ can be described to be a heavy "hu" sound that is a blend between "hu" and 
"fu".

### Observations

Japanese characters looking different handwritten and typed/print is similar 
to English. For example, "a" written in English does not have the type while 
print English does.

## Hiragana with Diacritical Marks

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-13/diacritics.jpg" width="300">

There are 25 further syllables that can be derived with diacrtic marks.

Dakuten (゛) turns the consonants k, s, t, and h into g, z, d, and b 
respectively.

Handakuten (゜) turns the consonant h into p.

|　| a | i | u | e | o |
| | あ | い | う | え | お |
| k | か | き | く | け | こ |
| g | が | ぎ | ぐ | げ | ご |
| s | さ | し (shi) | す | せ | そ |
| z | ざ | じ (ji) | ず | ぜ | ぞ |
| t | た | ち (chi) | つ (tsu) | て | と |
| d | だ | ぢ　(ji) | づ (tzu) | で | ど |
| h | は | ひ | ふ (fu) | へ | ほ |
| b | ば | び | ぶ | べ | ぼ |

| h | は | ひ | ふ (fu) | へ | ほ |
| p | ぱ | ぴ | ぷ | ぺ | ぽ |

### Observations

The sounds that are produced after adding a dakuten to k, s, and t make 
logical sense: k, s, and t are similar to g, z, and d respectively.

However, adding a dakuten to h to produce the b consonant and adding a 
handukuten to h to produce the p sound both do not make too much sense. It 
would be interesting to see why h becomes b and p.

## Transcribing Contracted Sounds

width="300">

A further 21 syllables are derived by contracting certain syllables with a 
small や, ゆ, and よ.

| | ya | yu | yo |
| k | きゃ | きゅ | きょ |
| s | しゃ (sha) | しゅ (shu) | しょ (sho) |
| t | ちゃ (cha) | ちゅ (chu) | ちょ (cho) |
| n | にゃ | にゅ | にょ |
| h | ひゃ | ひゅ | ひょ |
| m | みゃ | みゅ | みょ |
| r | りゃ | りゅ | りょ |

| g | ぎゃ | ぎゅ | ぎょ |
| z | じゃ (ja) | じゅ (ju) | じょ (jo) |
| b | びゃ | びゅ | びょ |
| p | ぴゃ | ぴゅ | ぴょ |

い vowel syllables are used for contraction.

## Transcribing Double Consonants

width="300">

Small つ is used for transcribing double consonants.

> かった — katta (won) \
> かた — kata (shoulder)

っ is not used to transcribe double consonant n sounds. Instead, ん is used 
along with a hiragana that has an initial n sound.

> さんねん — sannen \
> あんない — annai

### Observations

The use of っ to transcribe double consonants is similar to Urdu. In Urdu, شدّ
(shadda) is used:

<p style="font-size:64px; text-align:center;"> ّ  </p>

## Long Vowels

Same vowels that are placed consecutively next to each other are pronounced 
twice as long.

> おばあさん — obaasan (grandmother) \
> おばさん — obasan (aunt)

Long ee is typically transcribed by adding い instead of え. However, there 
are exceptions.

> えいが — eega \
> おねえさん — oneesan

Similarly, long oo is typically transcribed by adding う instead of お. Again, 
there are exceptions.

> ほうりつ — hooritsu \
> とお — too

### Observations

There is similarity with Urdu again. In Urdu, و ا and ی are used for long 
vowels while َ  ِ   and ُ are respectively used to denote short vowels.

## Pronunciation of ん

ん is pronounced nasally when it follows a vowel or completes an utterance.

> れんあい — rẽnai \
> ほん — hõ

### Observations

This letter is similar to ں (noon ghunna — نون غنّہ) in Urdu, which is used to 
produce 
nasal n.

## Accent

Japanese is a tonal language and generally has two tones: high and low pitch.
Accent can vary depending on the region.

## Dropped Vowels

i and u are sometimes dropped when placed between or at the end of voiceless 
consonants (those consonants which do not require your voicebox to work). 
Consonants in particular are k, s, t, p, and h.

> すきです — s(u)kides(u)

## Conclusion

Japanese does feel like a different language to me since it is a completely 
new writing system. It has more similarities to Urdu than English and has 
shown how difficult English is to learn as a language for nonnative speakers,
just from the alphabet itself (uppercase and lowercase letters look 
completely different in many cases and vowels themselves produce different 
sounds; e.g., the letter "i" makes the sound _eye_, _i_ and _ee_).
