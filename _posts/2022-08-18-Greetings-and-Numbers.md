## Greetings / あいさつ

Japanese has various exchanges for various different situations. They are 
typically accompanied by bowing, which can express gratitude, respect, or 
apologies. It can range to a slight nod of the head to a 45 degree bow from 
the waist. The longer and deeper the bow, the more formal and respectful it is.

When meeting in business situations, it is also customary to exchange 
business cards (めいし).

### Various greetings

**おはよう** is used typically before noon, though it is also used later in the day 
in casual settings or when classmates or coworkers are met for the first 
time in the day.

**こんにちは** is used in the afternoon.

**こんばんは** is used in the evening or during the night.

**おやすみなさい** is used as "Goodnight".

**さようなら** is a very formal, deepfelt goodbye; akin to how "Farewell" is 
supposed to be used in English. However, it's daily use is mainly kept to 
school children taking leave of thier teachers.

**じゃあ、また** is a much more casual goodbye statement. It is akin to "see you".

**しつれいします** is less formal than さようなら but more formal than じゃあ、また. For 
example, it can be used when taking leave of a professor's office.

### Exchanges

**すみません** is used in the following situations:
* To gain the attention of someone (akin to "excuse me")
* To apologize
* To show appreciation (akin to "thank you")

**いってきます** is spoken when a family member leaves the house. **いってらっしゃい** is 
spoken in reponse.

**ただいま** is spoken when a family member returns home. **おかえりなさい** is spoken 
in response.

**いってだきます** is spoken when you receive a meal. **ごちそうさまでして** is spoken after 
you finish a meal.

### ございます

ございます is added to certain phrases to make them more polite. For example, 
おはようございます and ありがとうございます.

## Numbers / すうじ

Numbers are easy. Let's see how.

### 0 - 10

| 0 | ゼロ / れい |
| 1 | いち |
| 2 | に |
| 3 | さん |
| 4 | よん / し / よ |
| 5 | ご |
| 6 | ろく |
| 7 | なな / しち |
| 8 | はち |
| 9 | きゅう / く |
| 10 | じゅう |

### 10 - 19

Now comes the easy part. To say the teens, you say 10 then the desired number.

| 10 | じゅう |
| 11 | じゅういち |
| 12 | じゅうに |
| 13 | じゅうさん |
| 14 | じゅうよん　/ じゅうし |
| 15 | じゅうご |
| 16 | じゅうろく |
| 17 | じゅうなな / じゅうしち |
| 18 | じゅうはち |
| 19 | じゅうきゅう / じゅうく |

### 10 - 90

Then tens are similarly, intuitively structured: you say the desired number 
then 10.

| 10 | じゅう |
| 20 | にじゅう |
| 30 | さんじゅう |
| 40 | よんじゅう |
| 50 | ごじゅう |
| 60 | ろくじゅう |
| 70 | ななじゅう |
| 80 | はちじゅう |
| 90 | きゅうじゅう |

## Conclusion

The Japanese have specific etiquettes for a variety of different situations, 
each with varying levels of respect and gratitude. However, respect and 
gratitude is always shown in those exchanges, becoming a part of the mindset 
and culture.

Numbers are structured like Mandarin and are intuitive too: instead of
saying, say, fifteeen, you say ten five. Likewise, instead of saying, say,
fourty, you say four ten.
